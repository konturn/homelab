## Stories

### Marathon 2021
**Tags:** athletic, commitment, perseverance
**Best for:** accomplishments, personal challenges, dedication questions

I ran a marathon in 2021 after months of intense training—up to 50 miles a week during peak periods. The training really tested my commitment, and the race itself was difficult, especially after mile 20. But I stuck with it through the pain and finished. I think intense physical challenges have a way of building mental resilience that carries over into other areas of life. Am actually training for the Cleveland marathon this spring!

**Short version (2-3 sentences):**
I ran a marathon in 2021 after training up to 50 miles a week. It tested my commitment and taught me about pushing through discomfort—especially those last 6 miles. Training for Cleveland this spring!

### Ping Pong / Competitive Sports
**Tags:** athletic, competitive, personal, sports
**Best for:** sports interest questions, hobbies, competitive nature, personal interests

I really enjoy ping pong. The competitive atmosphere gives me something I don't get in my day-to-day work — that direct, real-time back-and-forth where you're reading your opponent and reacting. When a good volley happens, it's almost like a dance between two players, both fully locked in. Beyond that, I've run marathons (trained up to 50 miles/week) and I'm training for Cleveland this spring. I'm drawn to activities that test focus and endurance.

**Short version:**
I'm into ping pong — love the competitive atmosphere and that back-and-forth flow when you're both locked in. Also run marathons. I'm drawn to things that test focus and endurance.

**For sports betting/fantasy specifically:**
I'm not deep into fantasy leagues, but I appreciate the appeal — it adds stakes and strategy to watching games. What interests me more is the engineering side: real-time systems, traffic spikes on game day, the reliability challenges when users have money on the line.
