## Positioning Notes

**Experience priority (most → least relevant):**
1. **Nvidia** — Most recent, most relevant. Lead with this.
2. **Octo** — Recent professional experience. Second priority.
3. **NASA** — Impressive but old. Use sparingly as a differentiator, not the main hook.

**Strengths to emphasize:**
- Nvidia/Octo experience = real production infrastructure work
- Math background = strong analytical foundation
- Theoretical CS interest = depth beyond typical SWE

**For infrastructure roles specifically:**
- Lead with Nvidia/Octo infrastructure work
- Emphasize automation, CI/CD, cloud experience from recent roles
- NASA can be a brief mention for differentiation, not the centerpiece

**Experience gap handling:**
- Most senior roles want 5-10+ YOE; Noah has ~3-4
- Startups often more flexible
- Recent Nvidia experience carries weight
- Focus on impact and autonomy over tenure
