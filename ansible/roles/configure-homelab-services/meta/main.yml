# configure-homelab-services requires Docker to be installed first.
# Ensure configure-docker runs before this role in the playbook.
# We don't use a meta dependency here because configure-docker is
# already listed explicitly in the playbook with host-specific vars
# (e.g. nvidia_container_runtime), and Ansible role deduplication
# could skip one of the two invocations.
