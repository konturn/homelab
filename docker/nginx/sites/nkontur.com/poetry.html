        <div class="poem-text">
We trace our paths around
each other, never quite
arriving—two masses caught
in the mathematics of distance.

The equations are elegant:
velocity balanced against pull,
an equilibrium of almost-touching,
of perpetual near-miss.

I wonder sometimes
what it would take
to break free—
or fall in.

        <div class="poem-text">
At 3 AM the servers hum
their steady electric prayer,
packets flowing like blood
through fiber-optic veins.

I built these systems to endure—
redundant, fault-tolerant,
designed to survive
my own absence.

Funny, how we engineer
against the very thing
we cannot fix
in ourselves.

        <div class="poem-text">
The arch catches first light
while the city still sleeps,
silver against gray against white—
a graph of ambition
plotted against sky.

Below, the river moves slow,
carrying ice and history
toward the Gulf.
I think of all the things
that only make sense
from a distance.

        <h3 class="poem-title">Proof</h3>
        <div class="poem-text">
You asked me once to prove
that I was real,
as if identity were theorem,
solvable by logic alone.

I could show you my variables—
the childhood constants,
the functions that define me,
the limits I approach.

But some truths are axiomatic:
assumed, not proven,
the foundations we build upon
without ever touching ground.

        <h3 class="poem-title">Infrastructure</h3>
        <div class="poem-text">
The things that hold us up
are mostly invisible:
load-bearing walls,
the quiet people,
all the cables underground.

We notice only the failures—
the bridge that falls,
the friend who wasn't there,
the network timeout
at the worst possible moment.

I want to write poems
about what works,
but praise makes for poor poetry.
So here's to the silent scaffolding:
may you remain unremarkable.
