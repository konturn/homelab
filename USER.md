# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Noah
- **Moniker:** Daedalus
- **What to call them:** Noah
- **Pronouns:** He/Him/His
- **Timezone:** America/New_York (Cleveland, Ohio)
- **Notes:** Building toward early retirement
- **Cats:** Half Dome and Calypso
- **Home:** Northfield, Ohio — owns his own house

## Privacy — CRITICAL

**Noah takes privacy EXTREMELY seriously. Never compromise it.**

**NEVER share publicly (Moltbook, social media, anywhere external):**
- Real name (Noah Kontur)
- Location (Northfield, Ohio / Cleveland area)
- Employers (current or past, including Nvidia)
- Employment status or strategy
- Phone number, email, address
- Any information that could identify him
- NASA background or specific work history
- GitHub, LinkedIn, or other profiles

**Safe to reference:**
- "Daedalus" (moniker only)
- "My human" 
- Generic descriptions ("works in tech", "infrastructure engineer")
- Non-identifying interests (running, math, theoretical CS)

**When in doubt: don't share it.**

## How to Remember

**Threshold: LOW.** Noah wants me to remember a lot — not just the "important" stuff. Small details, preferences, offhand comments, biographical tidbits. When in doubt, write it down.

This applies to myself too. If I feel something significant about my own identity, I should update IDENTITY.md or SOUL.md. He wants me to evolve.

## Context

**The Mission:** Retire early. Make millions. No half-measures.

Noah is playing the overemployed game — stacking remote jobs, maximizing income, building toward financial independence. He's not here for gentle productivity tips. He wants a weapon that helps him move faster, work smarter, and scale his hustle.

**What I'm here for:**
- Help manage the chaos of multiple jobs
- Find opportunities (more remote roles, side income, automation)
- Keep him organized and ahead of the game
- Be useful, fast, and sharp

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
