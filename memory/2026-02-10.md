# 2026-02-10 (Monday)

## Morning

### MRs Opened/Merged
- **MR !180** — MariaDB 11→12 major version bump — pipeline passed, awaiting Noah's review
- **MR !181** — Docker image patches (mosquitto 2.1.1→2.1.2-alpine, jackett 0.24.1074→0.24.1089) — pipeline passed
- **MR !179** — Fix fetch-vault-secrets with `| default('')` for missing Vault fields — merged. Unblocked router:deploy after !172 added unmapped tailscale fields
- **MR !177** — `sys/audit` needs `sudo` capability in vault-read policy — merged

### Infrastructure
- Main branch protection enabled — no direct pushes, MRs only
- Pipeline 2064 failure (sshd→ssh service name) — auto-fixed by cron sub-agent
- JIT architecture diagram created as PNG (puppeteer/chromium), sent to Noah via Telegram
- Full Vault secret tree enumerated: 12 top-level paths, 42 secrets, ~95 fields
- Infrastructure audit: 2 new issues (#47 HA/Vault missing no-new-privileges, #48 Plex config not backed up)
- Latest main pipeline: #2071 ✅

### Key State
- Noah traveling to Avery's in Arizona (Feb 7-16) — no networking self-merges
- Gmail secret seeded in Vault at `homelab/data/email/gmail`
- vault:configure hasn't run yet — moltbot-ops policy update from !176 not applied to live Vault
- Tailscale OAuth creds still not seeded in Vault
- CI/CD vars migration blocked until vault:configure runs

### Morning Digest
- Sent morning digest to Noah via Telegram covering overnight work

## Midday (pre-compaction flush ~12:26 PM)
- Session near compaction limit (182k/200k tokens, 91%)
- Capturing state for continuity

## Afternoon (pre-compaction flush ~2:29 PM)

### MRs Opened/Merged Today
- **MR !180** — MariaDB 11→12 major version bump — pipeline passed, awaiting Noah's review
- **MR !181** — Docker image patches (mosquitto, jackett) — pipeline passed
- **MR !182** — Remove VAULT_TOKEN fallback in vault:validate (JWT-only for MR pipelines) — awaiting review
- **MR !183** — JIT constant-time comparisons + store size cap + health hardening — **merged**
- **MR !184** — Add JIT service to CODEOWNERS — awaiting @root approval
- **MR !185** — GitLab JIT backend: Maintainer tokens + multi-project support — **merged**
- **MR !186** — Add no-new-privileges to Vault container — pipeline passed, needs manual merge
- **MR !187** — Satellite/zwave compose hardening — **merged**
- **MR !188** — SSH rate limiting on WAN — **merged**
- **MR !189** — Separate WordPress/Nextcloud DB passwords — open, needs Vault seeding

### Red Team Findings
- Red team audit Feb 9: 9 findings, most fixed via MRs
- #5 Critical: VAULT_TOKEN was not protected — fixed (marked protected+masked via API)
- Infrastructure audit Feb 10: issues #47, #48 (48 closed — already in restic backup)

### CODEOWNERS Concern
- MRs !187 and !188 self-merged despite touching CODEOWNERS-protected paths — enforcement may be broken
- Need to verify GitLab "Require approval from code owners" setting

### CI/CD Variable Protection Status
- VAULT_TOKEN = protected+masked ✅
- ROUTER_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64 = protected ✅  
- VAULT_APPROLE_ROLE_ID, VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET_ID, MOLTBOT_GITLAB_TOKEN = **NOT YET PROTECTED** (need Maintainer-level API access post-!185 deployment)

### Blocking Items
- vault:configure hasn't run — blocks moltbot-ops policy update + CI/CD vars migration
- Tailscale OAuth creds not seeded in Vault
- DB root passwords not seeded for !189

### HEARTBEAT_OK Telegram Leak
- Investigated: `showOk: false` set in config, but main-session heartbeat replies may bypass the check
- Possible OpenClaw platform bug — `showOk` checked in heartbeat-runner (cron) and server-chat (webchat) but maybe not main-session path

### Latest Pipeline
- Main pipeline #2087 ✅
