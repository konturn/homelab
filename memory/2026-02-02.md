## 01:18 — Skill Update: Simplify Detection

**Issue:** v3 job application worker searched DOM for "autofill" buttons and found Greenhouse's native "Autofill with MyGreenhouse" instead of Simplify Copilot. Simplify is an overlay/sidebar panel, not a DOM element.

**Fix:** Updated job-hunting skill to clarify:
- Simplify appears as OVERLAY PANEL on side of page
- Do NOT search form HTML for "autofill" buttons
- Use screenshot to detect Simplify visually
- Listed what IS vs IS NOT Simplify
