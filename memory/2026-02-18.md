## 21:15 — Root-caused empty MR bug from sub-agents

Sub-agents creating MRs via GitLab API were targeting `master` instead of `main`. The homelab repo default branch is `main`. Result: MR shows no changes because `master` either doesn't exist or matches the source branch.

**Fix:** Updated gitlab-mr SKILL.md gotcha #1 to explicitly state default branch is `main`. Going forward, all sub-agent task prompts that mention creating MRs must include `target_branch: main`.

Affected MRs: !333 (alert fixes), !346 (influxdb T2) — both had empty diffs, had to redo manually.
