# 2026-01-31 Session Notes

## Job Application Batch

Ran a job application batch at Noah's request. Target: 5 applications.

### Successful Applications (4 confirmed)
1. **AcuityMD** - Software Engineer, Infrastructure ($180k-$210k) - Greenhouse, xdotool resume upload
2. **Sequen AI** - Staff SWE Infrastructure ($250k-$300k) - Simple Ashby form
3. **Found** - Senior SWE Data Infrastructure ($181k-$241k) - Fintech for self-employed
4. **Persona** - Software Engineer, Compute ($130k-$220k) - Identity verification company

### Chainalysis Status: UNCERTAIN
- Attempted 3 times with different strategies
- Worker claimed success (fields disabled, submit button disabled)
- Noah skeptical - may not have actually gone through
- No confirmation message visible in snapshot
- Yes/No toggle buttons still showed clickable state
- **Need to verify manually or re-check**

### Retry Queue (3 jobs)
- Oscar Health - Greenhouse resume upload issue
- Leidos - Workday timeout at step 4/8
- Icmarc - Workday partial (got past auth with hover-then-click)

### Key Learnings Tonight

**Hover-then-click for Workday:**
Unresponsive buttons in Workday (Create Account, Submit, etc.) often need hover before click to trigger JavaScript event handlers. Added to skill.

**Ashby React State Management:**
- DOM manipulation doesn't update React state
- File uploads "succeed" at DOM level but React doesn't see them
- **Solution:** Use Autofill feature first - it updates React state properly
- Alternative: xdotool for native OS interaction

**Never run workers in parallel:**
I mistakenly spawned Icmarc and Chainalysis workers simultaneously. Noah corrected me emphatically. Even with different browser profiles, workers can clobber each other on the node. Updated skill to make this crystal clear.

**Hiring Cafe URL improvement:**
Added `hideJobTypes: ["Applied", "Viewed"]` to search URL - Hiring Cafe itself now filters out seen jobs.

## Nightly Retry System Created

Set up automated retry system for failed applications:
- `retry-queue.json` - jobs awaiting retry
- `abandoned.json` - jobs that failed 5 times
- Cron job at 3 AM ET picks random job, spawns retry agent with context
- Retry agents try creative strategies (xdotool, JS injection, coordinate clicking)
- If solved, agent documents what worked for skill improvement

## Mysterious Phone Number

Noah noticed phone number `503-867-5039` appearing somewhere in Chainalysis form. Not in any of our files or transcripts. Theories:
1. Browser autofill from Noah's machine
2. Anti-automation honeypot (suspiciously close to "867-5309" Jenny song)
3. Form pre-populating canary value to detect bots

Never resolved - grep found nothing in transcripts.

## Token/Energy Cost Estimate

Per application:
- Simple Ashby: ~50-70k tokens
- Complex (Greenhouse, Workday): ~100-120k tokens
- Rough energy: ~100-300 Wh per 100k tokens
- Cost: ~$1-4 per application at Sonnet pricing
