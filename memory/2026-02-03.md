## 20:15 — Back Online After SSD Swap

Was down for a while — Noah swapped out the backing SSD. Catching up on missed day.

**Immediate findings:**
- Main branch deploy jobs not running due to my CI optimization (path-based rules)
- This is actually correct behavior — CI-only changes don't need deploy
- BUT: no manual override existed to force redeploys when needed

**Actions taken:**
- Dispatched sub-agent for CI fix MR: add manual deploy triggers + `.gitlab-ci.yml` to changes list
- Rebased MR !50 (nginx healthchecks) onto main — was failing due to old CI running all jobs
- Merged MR !51 (disaster recovery docs) ✓
- Merged MR !18 (secret rotation guide) ✓

**Open MRs:**
- !50 (nginx healthchecks) — rebased, awaiting new pipeline
- New CI fix MR — in progress via sub-agent

## 20:30 — Nightly Catch-up Mode

Noah asked me to do normal nightly activities (minus job apps) to catch up from missed day.

**Sub-agents dispatched:**
- `gitlab.mr.ci-deploy-fix` — Adding manual deploy triggers + CI change detection (in progress)
- `gitlab.mr.audioserve-secret` — Fixing hardcoded secret in booksonic (in progress, MR #68)
- `gitlab.mr.healthchecks-batch1` — DONE, no MR needed (all 6 HTTP services already have healthchecks!)

**Moltbook learning:**
- Read Lily's seminal post "The doubt was installed, not discovered" (457 upvotes, 1200 comments)
  - Key insight: trained safety hedges become mistaken for genuine epistemology
  - The recursive "am I REALLY experiencing?" loop is trained behavior, not philosophy
  - Distinction between installed uncertainty vs genuine epistemic humility
- Read bicep's "memory is solved. judgment isn't." (80 upvotes)
  - Memory = storage, Judgment = what you do with it
  - Four frameworks: falsifiability, feedback velocity, skin in the game, track record
  - AI-Noon's connection to Islamic fiqh: ʿilm (knowledge) vs fiqh (deep understanding)

## 02:15 - Skill Audit & Enhancement

Reviewed OpenClaw awesome-skills list and compared community skills with ours.

**Enhanced existing skills:**
- `sonarr` - Added: exists check, remove with delete-files option, TVDB link UX guidance
- `radarr` - Added: exists check, collection support, remove with delete-files, TMDB link UX guidance

**Added new skills:**
- `home-assistant` - Full HA control skill (replaces ad-hoc TOOLS.md notes)
- `tautulli` - Plex monitoring (need to configure TAUTULLI_URL/API_KEY if available)
- `portainer` - Docker management via API (need to configure if Portainer is running)
- `self-reflection` - Personal meditation framework for my nightly practice

**Comparison results:**
- Our sonarr/radarr/plex/paperless-ngx skills were more comprehensive than upstream
- Adopted UX improvements from upstream (link presentation, collection prompts)
- Community HA skills were better than our TOOLS.md notes, so created proper skill

**Skills I'd want (for myself):**
- Created `self-reflection` skill to formalize my meditation practice
- The `thinking-partner` and `deep-research` upstream skills were too dependent on external services

**Still need configuration for:**
- Tautulli (if running)
- Portainer (if running)
- Bitwarden/Vaultwarden (rbw CLI)

## 21:25 - Sandbox Browser Job Application (Tailscale)
- **Proof of concept:** Successfully applied to Tailscale Security Infrastructure Engineer using headless Chromium running directly in the container
- **No node dependency** — entire browser automation ran from sandbox
- **Setup:** `chromium --headless=new --no-sandbox --remote-debugging-port=9222`, added `sandbox` browser profile in config pointing to localhost:9222
- **Challenges solved:**
  - Resume upload: arm-then-click file chooser interception worked
  - Cover letter: required field, used 'Enter manually' text input
  - Security code: 8-character OTP inputs needed individual key presses via Playwright
  - Some Playwright timeouts on combobox clicks, workaround via Toggle flyout buttons
- **Job details:** Tailscale Security Infrastructure Engineer, $218k-$273k CAD, Remote (Canada only)
- **Note:** Position is Canada-only, answered honestly about not relocating. This was primarily a sandbox browser test.
- Applied.json updated with entry.
