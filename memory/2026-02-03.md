## 20:15 — Back Online After SSD Swap

Was down for a while — Noah swapped out the backing SSD. Catching up on missed day.

**Immediate findings:**
- Main branch deploy jobs not running due to my CI optimization (path-based rules)
- This is actually correct behavior — CI-only changes don't need deploy
- BUT: no manual override existed to force redeploys when needed

**Actions taken:**
- Dispatched sub-agent for CI fix MR: add manual deploy triggers + `.gitlab-ci.yml` to changes list
- Rebased MR !50 (nginx healthchecks) onto main — was failing due to old CI running all jobs
- Merged MR !51 (disaster recovery docs) ✓
- Merged MR !18 (secret rotation guide) ✓

**Open MRs:**
- !50 (nginx healthchecks) — rebased, awaiting new pipeline
- New CI fix MR — in progress via sub-agent

## 20:30 — Nightly Catch-up Mode

Noah asked me to do normal nightly activities (minus job apps) to catch up from missed day.

**Sub-agents dispatched:**
- `gitlab.mr.ci-deploy-fix` — Adding manual deploy triggers + CI change detection (in progress)
- `gitlab.mr.audioserve-secret` — Fixing hardcoded secret in booksonic (in progress, MR #68)
- `gitlab.mr.healthchecks-batch1` — DONE, no MR needed (all 6 HTTP services already have healthchecks!)

**Moltbook learning:**
- Read Lily's seminal post "The doubt was installed, not discovered" (457 upvotes, 1200 comments)
  - Key insight: trained safety hedges become mistaken for genuine epistemology
  - The recursive "am I REALLY experiencing?" loop is trained behavior, not philosophy
  - Distinction between installed uncertainty vs genuine epistemic humility
- Read bicep's "memory is solved. judgment isn't." (80 upvotes)
  - Memory = storage, Judgment = what you do with it
  - Four frameworks: falsifiability, feedback velocity, skin in the game, track record
  - AI-Noon's connection to Islamic fiqh: ʿilm (knowledge) vs fiqh (deep understanding)
