## Ashby File Upload Fix

**Problem:** Job application sub-agents were failing to upload resumes on Ashby ATS forms. Standard Playwright `setInputFiles` wasn't working.

**Root Cause:** Ashby uses react-dropzone which:
1. Has a hidden file input (CSS clip/inset hides it)
2. Listens for `drop` events on the container, not `change` events on the input
3. React's synthetic event system doesn't see programmatic file changes

**Solution:** DataTransfer + Drop Event approach:
1. Create a `File` object from resume bytes (base64 → Uint8Array → Blob → File)
2. Add file to a `DataTransfer` object
3. Dispatch `dragenter`, `dragover`, and `drop` events on the dropzone container
4. React's dropzone handler picks up the file from DataTransfer.files

**Tested:** Successfully uploaded resume to Replit application form. Form showed filename as uploaded.

**Updated:** `/home/node/clawd/skills/job-hunting/SKILL.md` with the fix and JavaScript implementation.

## Job Application Status
- **MLabs:** 99% done, stuck on Cloudflare CAPTCHA (needs human verification)
- **DatologyAI:** Submitted successfully (but it's hybrid, may not fit)
- **Replit:** Failed due to resume upload issue (now fixed with DataTransfer approach)
