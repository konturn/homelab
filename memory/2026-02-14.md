## 03:32 — Docker Image Update MRs Blocked
**Task:** Create 3 MRs for docker image updates (patch updates, MariaDB minor, pin unpinned images)
**Blocker:** `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var is revoked (`invalid_token: Token was revoked`). JIT T2 request `req-0610153d695d` pending Telegram approval but it's 3:32 AM.
**Skipped images (documented):**
- grafana/grafana: latest_tag (12.3) older than current (12.4), unreliable comparison
- grafana/loki & promtail: 3.6 → 3.5.10 is a downgrade
- nextcloud: variant change (fpm → fpm-alpine), risky
- plexinc/pms-docker: unknown update type, same minor version
- wordpress: variant change (php8.3-apache → php8.5-fpm-alpine), completely different
**Status:** Will notify Noah; task needs retry after token is available.

## 12:01 — Cron Config Sync
Cron jobs.json changed, committed locally (ceed527) but push failed — SSH key denied on GitLab. Key fingerprint matches but server rejects it. Needs investigation.

## 12:46 — Vault Path Lesson
- Vault KV paths in the homelab are `homelab/data/...` NOT `secret/data/...`
- GitLab PAT stored at `homelab/data/moltbot/gitlab` (key: `token`)
- JIT `vault_write` helper requires paths starting with `homelab/data/`
- The `vault_write` function in jit-lib.sh handles the JIT request+write flow — use it next time
- Also: JIT API endpoint is `/request` with `X-JIT-API-Key` header, NOT `/api/request` with `Authorization: Bearer`
