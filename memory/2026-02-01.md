## Overnight Work (00:00-06:00)

**01:10** — Noah pointed out I wasn't being proactive enough during heartbeats. Updated HEARTBEAT.md with explicit "overnight heartbeat protocol" — every heartbeat when he's AFK, I should DO something.

**01:12** — Dispatched first proactive MR: `gitlab.mr.healthchecks` — adding Docker healthchecks to nginx containers.

**01:25** — Created `agent-backlog` label in GitLab, migrated 11 backlog items to issues. Updated HEARTBEAT.md to reference GitLab issues instead of inline checklist.

**01:35** — Split `mr-and-pipeline-monitor` cron into two: `mr-comment-monitor` (every 10 min) and `main-pipeline-fix` (every 30 min) to reduce race conditions.

**01:45** — MR #29 (GitLab Container Registry) created and merged.

**01:56** — Consolidated gitlab-mr skills: removed monolith, kept `gitlab-mr-create` and `gitlab-mr-respond`. Added explicit pipeline failure handling (fetch logs, diagnose, fix, retry up to 3x).

**02:00** — GitLab went down (502), came back, went weird (404 on API). Noah fixed it.

**02:10** — MR #29 merged. Registry needs DNS/nginx setup for `gitlab-registry.lab.nkontur.com`.

**02:31** — Created `job-search-nightly` cron (2 AM) for proactive job hunting when laptop node is up.

## Earlier (from 2026-01-31 evening)

**~22:30** — Discussed sandboxed browser for job applications. Created MR #25 to add Chromium to moltbot container.

**~22:40** — Chainalysis application successfully submitted. ICMARC partially completed.

**00:20** — Created job-hunting project in knowledge graph.
