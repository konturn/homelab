## 02:00 — MR Comment Monitor (Cron)

GitLab API returning 404 for all `/api/v4/` endpoints. The web UI works but API routes are not being proxied correctly through nginx.

**Issue:** Cannot check MR states or fetch discussions — API access broken.

Need to investigate nginx reverse proxy configuration for GitLab.
