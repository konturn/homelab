## Overnight Work (00:00-06:00)

**01:10** — Noah pointed out I wasn't being proactive enough during heartbeats. Updated HEARTBEAT.md with explicit "overnight heartbeat protocol" — every heartbeat when he's AFK, I should DO something (infrastructure MR, skill improvement, self-improvement, research, or creative work).

**01:12** — Dispatched first proactive MR: `gitlab.mr.healthchecks` — adding Docker healthchecks to GitLab, Nginx, Nextcloud, Home Assistant. Builds on MR #4 pattern.

## Earlier (from 2026-01-31 evening)

**~22:30** — Discussed sandboxed browser for job applications. Created MR #25 to add Chromium to moltbot container. Noah asked about xvfb for xdotool compatibility — recommended xvfb over pure headless for lower captcha risk.

**~22:40** — Chainalysis application was successfully submitted by retry sub-agent. ICMARC partially completed (discovered hover-then-click workaround).

**00:20** — Created job-hunting project in knowledge graph (`/life/areas/projects/job-hunting/`).
