# 2026-01-30 — Daily Log

## Evening Session (~17:30 EST)

Noah requested I work proactively like an employee — do work that makes his life easier, create MRs for review, don't push live.

### MRs Created Today
- [x] MR !6 — CI safe validation (merged)
- [x] MR !7 — Runner concurrency 5→20 (merged)
- [x] MR !8 — Persistent cache via Docker volume mounts (open, tracking)

### Infrastructure Built
- Created `gitlab-mr` skill — full MR lifecycle with fresh clones, glab setup
- Set up MR comment monitoring — cron polls every 5 min, spawns sub-agents to respond
- Tracking file: `memory/open-mrs.json`

### Key Lessons Persisted
- Never do MRs myself — always delegate to sub-agents
- Exponential backoff everywhere for polling
- Main session must stay responsive

### Tonight's Directive (~18:15 EST)
Noah wants to wake up surprised and excited by MRs I create overnight. Ideas:
- [ ] Container resource limits / memory caps
- [ ] Healthchecks for critical containers
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting improvements  
- [ ] Home Assistant automations
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Service documentation

### Job Applications (carried forward)
26 applications submitted — see `skills/job-hunting/references/applied.json`
