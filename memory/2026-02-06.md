## 00:30 — Overnight Performance Audit

### GitLab API Latency
| Endpoint | Cold (1st) | Warm (2nd) |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| /projects/4 | 1.42s | 0.21s |
| /merge_requests | 0.20s | 0.19s |
| /pipelines | 0.62s | 0.16s |
| /branches | 0.39s | 0.12s |
| /jobs | 0.80s | 0.70s |

Jobs endpoint consistently slow even warm (700ms). All other services <11ms.

### Container Resources
| Container | Memory | CPU% |
|-----------|--------|------|
| gitlab | 5,352 MB | 116% |
| deluge | 1,560 MB | 56% |
| homeassistant | 533 MB | - |
| moltbot-gateway | 392 MB | 6% |
| wordpress_db | 335 MB | - |
| influxdb | 301 MB | 1% |
| sonarr | 270 MB | - |
| radarr | 224 MB | 7% |

GitLab memory down from ~8GB to 5.3GB after !111 tuning. CPU high during pipeline runs.

### Observations
- GitLab /jobs endpoint is the main perf bottleneck (700ms warm)
- Deluge using 1.5GB RAM seems high for a torrent client
- All non-GitLab services respond in <11ms — healthy
- Pipeline just ran so GitLab CPU is elevated

### Action Items
- Investigate GitLab /jobs API slowness — likely Sidekiq job table bloat
- Check if Deluge 1.5GB is normal or indicates a leak
- Consider PostgreSQL VACUUM on GitLab's ci_builds table
