## 00:30 — Mosquitto Healthcheck Fix
- Root cause: BusyBox `nc -z localhost` fails in read_only container with cap_drop ALL (DNS resolution broken)
- Fix: `echo | nc -w1 127.0.0.1 1883` — confirmed working inside container
- MR !329 created for the fix (separate from !328 which fixed MQTT TLS port)
- 10.6.128.18 identified as IoT device with FN-LINK WiFi chip (still trying TLS on port 1883)

## 00:49 — Job Applications Batch 2 (partial)
- Virta Health ✅ (Ashby, reCAPTCHA solved via 2captcha)
- HackerOne ✅ (Ashby, deadline March 15)
- Medallion ✅ (Greenhouse, open-ended questions answered)
- Noah cut apps after Medallion due to 4hr usage limit
- 13 remaining jobs saved to `skills/job-hunting/references/scout-batch2-queue.md`
- Total applied: 55

## 00:45 — Sub-agent MR Bug Root-Caused
- Sub-agents were targeting `target_branch: "master"` instead of `"main"` in GitLab API
- Caused empty-diff MRs (!333, !346)
- Fixed: Updated gitlab-mr SKILL.md gotcha #1, added to MEMORY.md
- Must always include `target_branch: main` in sub-agent task prompts

## 20:00 — InfluxDB JIT T2 Write Access
- MR !347 merged: InfluxDB backend now tier-aware (T1=read, T2+=read+write)
- Successfully created `homeassistant` bucket via T2 token (first use!)
- T2 write:buckets works but can't create authorizations (different permission)
- Noah provided persistent HA write token manually

## 00:32 — HA → InfluxDB Integration
- Token stored in Vault at `homelab/data/influxdb/ha-write`
- Grafana datasource `influxdb-ha` (uid: influxdb-ha) created via API
- MR !348: HA configuration.yaml + vault secrets fetch for the integration
- Included domains: sensor, binary_sensor, climate, weather, lock, light, switch, cover, fan, person, device_tracker, input_boolean

## 00:36 — Mac Mini Found & Static IP Assigned
- Hostname: Noahs-Mac-mini
- MAC: 1c:f6:4c:56:b5:ba
- Static IP: 10.4.128.24 (mgmt VLAN)
- MR !349 created
- Also found: Noahs-MBP-3 (84:2f:57:03:cf:43) at 10.4.114.94 (left DHCP)

## SSH JIT Cert Extraction Lesson
- JIT SSH response has `token` (private key) and `metadata.certificate` (the cert)
- Must extract cert with `jq -r '.metadata.certificate' | tr -d '\n'`
- Name cert file as `keyname-cert.pub` for SSH auto-discovery
- Use both: `-i /tmp/jit-key5` (private key from .token) + cert at `keyname-cert.pub`

## Grafana Alert Fixes
- MR !334: Fix noisy alerts
  - Container health: exclude audioserve + nextcloud (long-term broken)
  - All `noDataState: NoData` → `OK` (prevents false Datasourcenodata emails)
- UPS/SMART alerts already commented out, not the source of emails

## Model Discussion
- Noah asked about switching to Sonnet 4.6
- My take: 80% of work is sonnet-tier, 20% benefits from opus
- Suggested: sonnet for main session, opus sub-agents for complex tasks
- No decision made yet

## Infra Map Updates
- Mac Mini: 10.4.128.24 (mgmt VLAN)
- Noah's MBP: 10.4.114.94 (DHCP, mgmt VLAN)

## 00:58 — Session Summary (pre-compaction flush)
- Apple subscription expiring email received — flagged for Noah
- Pipeline #2455 failed: DNS resolution on router (Tailscale API) — infra issue, escalated
- Pending MRs count: ~15 awaiting Noah's merge (!303, !305, !307, !311, !312, !313, !314, !315, !325, !327, !328, !331, !332, !334, !348, !349)
- Restic still locked (40 days!) — Noah needs to run `restic unlock`
- iMessage via Mac Mini: next step is SSH setup, restricted user, JIT T2 resource config

## 13:00-17:30 — Afternoon Session

### Flagstaff Trip Planning (Feb 28 weekend)
- Searched Airbnb for downtown Flagstaff Feb 27-Mar 1 via sandbox Chromium
- Top picks: Cozy Downtown Apt ($345, 4.95★), Couples Retreat w/ Hot Tub ($503), The Farmhouse ($481, 4.97★), Bootleggers Bungalow ($440, 5.0★)
- Sent screenshots + links to Noah via Telegram
- Oscar nominated short films at Harkins Camelview (Scottsdale, ~15min from Tempe)
  - Thu Feb 26: Live Action 12:15, Documentary 3:10, Animated 6:35
  - Wed Feb 25: Animated 1:30, Live Action 3:50, Documentary 6:45
  - Tempe Marketplace doesn't show Oscar shorts

### ClawShell DLP Proxy
- Audited ClawShell source code (14K lines Rust) — CLEAN. No telemetry, no phone-home, `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`
- MR !353 created: ClawShell as Docker sidecar container
  - Dedicated `clawshell` bridge network (only moltbot + clawshell)
  - Read-only container, no caps, 64MB limit
  - Config with DLP rules (name, employers, SSN, credit cards, email)
  - Vault integration for Anthropic API key at `homelab/data/clawshell/anthropic`
  - Pipeline green
- Discussed service proxy architecture: JIT evolution into request proxy with path ACLs, DLP, JWT grants
- Key insight: ClawShell for LLM traffic, future service proxy for GitLab/Grafana/HA — orthogonal

### Grafana Webhook Alerts
- Enabled OpenClaw webhook endpoint at `/hooks/wake` (token generated)
- Created JS relay at `127.0.0.1:18791` to reformat Grafana payload → wake format
  - Grafana sends `{"status":"firing","alerts":[...]}`, wake needs `{"text":"..."}`
  - Hook mapping transforms failed ("hook mapping failed") — relay is workaround
- Created Grafana contact point `OpenClaw Webhook` via API
- MR !354 created: Provisioned webhook contact point + notification policy (pipeline green)
- Updated email-check cron to skip Grafana alert emails
- **CONFIRMED WORKING**: Received live UPS Battery Low alert via webhook at 3:06 PM
- Relay process needs persistence across container restarts

### Infrastructure Issues
- MR !352 created for issues #67 (Prowlarr port), #68 (ZFS snapshots), #69 (MQTT localhost)
  - Issue #68 closed: zfs-auto-snapshot already running via cron (frequent/5min + hourly)
  - Removed ZFS snapshot role from MR, updated description
- `.gitignore` rewritten — was broken (last-match-wins ordering). Now tracks job hunting data, memory state, skill configs
- Banned `git add -A` in AGENTS.md — root cause of garbled commits
- Removed stale git submodules (homelab-mr11, homelab-paperless-t2, images-repo)
- Pushed 4 previously untracked memory files (daily logs + redteam reports)

### Key Decisions
- ClawShell as separate container (not in moltbot) for real process isolation
- Privacy.com prepaid cards for future agent purchasing (discussed, not implemented)
- Grafana alerts via webhook > email cron checking (near-realtime vs 3x/day)
- DLP patterns: block SSN/CC, redact name/employers/email/address

### Pending
- Noah needs to store Anthropic key in Vault for ClawShell deployment
- Relay needs containerization or entrypoint integration
- UPS battery low alert firing since ~7:23 AM — needs physical check
